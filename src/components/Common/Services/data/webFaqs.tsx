          Companies from 8 industries requested our support in custom
          development, including FinTech, E-commerce, Healthcare, Media and
          Entertainment, EdTech, Travel and Hospitality, Retail, and Information
          Technology.

          By design, our web development process must match or exceed market
          standards, or The Software House won’t have work continuity. Many
          times, clients see that it’s true after the first sprint.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8 text-lg font-light">
          We use delivery practices that increase efficiency in each of our web
          development projects and aggregate data to measure and display
          development velocity.
        </p>
        <p className="my-8 text-lg font-light">
          Team members join projects only when they’re needed: design begins
          first, the backend comes next, and the frontend joins later.

          Partners can track development metrics through Jira at any time,
          observing tasks entering production, which ones return, and how fast
          our team delivers web solutions.

          For frontend development, we work with React, TypeScript, Angular, or
          Vue.js. On the backend, we use Node.js, PHP, Python, and TypeScript.
